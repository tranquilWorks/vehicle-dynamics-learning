# Vehicle Dynamics and Motorsport Engineering

A MATLAB-first, Khan-Academy-style learning track with 24 guided modules.

Each implemented module combines:

- a concise lesson and physical mental model;
- MATLAB `%%` notebook cells;
- deterministic plots;
- actual UI sliders, spinners, or dropdowns;
- two parameter sweeps;
- one deliberately broken case;
- executable numerical checks;
- a tutor protocol that asks one observation question at a time.

## Start

From a shell:

```bash
./bin/learn start
./bin/learn start P01
./bin/learn list
./bin/learn status
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
python .\bin\learn.py start
```

In MATLAB:

```matlab
launch_lesson("P02")
run_module_checks("P02")
```

Only after the checks actually pass and the learner gives a short teach-back, record local progress:

```bash
./bin/learn complete P02 --checks-passed --teach-back "Force mechanism; observable consequence."
```

The CLI refuses to write completion state when either confirmation is missing.

`P01` is the reference implementation. The manifest is the source of truth for the current
contiguous implemented frontier; later modules remain explicit scaffolds until their bounded batch
is implemented and verified.

## Learning contract

The flow is always:

> question → mental model → baseline → manipulate levers → observe plots → break an assumption → explain → check → teach back

This repository is compatible with the same tutor/build split used by `dsp-radar_learning`.
