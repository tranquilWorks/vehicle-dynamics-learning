# Vehicle Dynamics and Motorsport Engineering

A MATLAB-first, Khan-Academy-style learning track with 24 guided modules.

Each implemented module combines:

- a concise lesson and physical mental model;
- MATLAB `%%` notebook cells;
- deterministic plots;
- actual UI sliders, spinners, or dropdowns;
- two parameter sweeps;
- one deliberately broken case;
- executable numerical checks;
- a tutor protocol that asks one observation question at a time.

## Start

From a shell:

```bash
./bin/learn start
./bin/learn start P01
./bin/learn list
./bin/learn status
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
python .\bin\learn.py start
```

In MATLAB:

```matlab
launch_lesson("P01")
run_module_checks("P01")
```

`P01` is a complete reference implementation. The remaining modules are intentionally scaffolded so each can be implemented in a bounded, reviewable batch.

## Module layout

## Learning contract

The flow is always:

> question → mental model → baseline → manipulate levers → observe plots → break an assumption → explain → check → teach back

This repository is compatible with the same tutor/build split used by `dsp-radar_learning`.
